# OpenSourceScript
After spending 6 months to a year on and off going through MOOC FI's Java courses and then EDX's Georgia Tech DSA courses,
I realized I don't have any Java projects. This one right here is my first GUI project. I didn't follow any tutorials out of the
actual Java Swing documentation and looked up random things on Stack OverFlow along the way. It's a poor man's knock off a 
screenwriting software like Final Draft. I grew up wanting to write stories and be a screenwriter. Film has always been my favorite art form. Over time I'd love to add more and more to it but I need to learn the Spring Framework
and leetcode or else I'll never be able to make a braggadocious Blind+Reddit post on how I'm a self taught faang developer. All of the menu buttons
work. I think this graduates me to an official intermediate Java Developer.
